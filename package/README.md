# GPU Animation 🎠

This package helps baking skinned mesh animations for animating on the GPU and thus using instanced rendering features.

Currently supports builtin rendering only

## How To Use 💡
1) Right click in the ``Project View``
2) Select ``Create/Animation/BakedAnimation``
3) Select the created object and drag your animated model (e.g. fbx) into the ``GameObject`` field.
4) Drag your animation clips in the ``Animations`` list
5) Done. Your animations are now ready to be used on the gpu. Use the ``PreviewBakedAnimation`` component to see the baked animation.

**TODO**: proper getting started and sample

## In Production ⚙️
GPU Animation is currently in development for our own game at [@ElaborateGames](https://github.com/elaborate-games)
